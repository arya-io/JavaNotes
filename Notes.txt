## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

A language is considered Object-Oriented if it supports the following key features:

1. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
2. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class), which supports **data hiding**.
3. **Inheritance**: Mechanism where a new class (child) inherits properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class (parent).
4. **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object or method to behave differently in different contexts:
   - **Static/Compile-Time Polymorphism** (Early Binding): The method to be called is determined at compile time. The output remains consistent across different executions.
   - **Dynamic/Run-Time Polymorphism** (Late Binding): The method to be called is determined at runtime, allowing different outputs depending on the object type.
5. **Modularity**: Dividing the program into smaller, manageable, and reusable modules (classes or packages), improving maintainability.
6. **Serialization**: The process of converting an object and its metadata into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
7. **Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI)**: The ability to determine the type of an object at runtime. For example, if a class hierarchy includes `Parrot -> Bird -> FlyingObject`, at runtime, the exact type (Parrot) can be identified.
8. **Persistence**: The capability of an object to store its state (data) over time, typically by saving to a database or file.
9. **Concurrency**: The ability to execute multiple threads simultaneously, enabling parallel execution (multithreading).

---

### **Minor Features of OOP in Java:**

- **Persistence**: Refers to the ability of an object to persist (retain) its data even after the program terminates. This is typically achieved using files, databases, or other storage mechanisms.
- **Serialization**: Involves saving the state of an object (along with its metadata) to a file, allowing it to be reconstructed later.
- **Concurrency**: The capability to perform multiple operations at the same time through multithreading.
- **Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI)**: A mechanism to identify an object's type at runtime, ensuring proper method execution based on the actual object.

---

### **Comparing OOP in Different Languages**

- **C and C++**:
  - They support key OOP features like Concurrency and RTTI, but they are not considered 100% OOP because they allow global variables and functions.
  - Example: `int temp` is a primitive in C/C++, but C++ can also have `temp.value()` where the variable shows behavior (through methods).
  
- **.NET**:
  - .NET is considered 100% Object-Oriented because:
    1. It supports all OOP features.
    2. No global variables or functions are allowed.
    3. Everything is treated as an object, even basic data types.

---

### **Static Keyword in Java**

- **Static Members**: Methods or variables that belong to the class, rather than an instance. You can access them without creating an object of the class. Example: `ClassName.staticMethod()`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **API (Application Programming Interface)**

- **Definition**: An API is an interface that allows software programs to communicate with each other. It provides predefined functions or methods that developers can use to interact with a software library, framework, or service, enabling them to build applications efficiently.
- **Purpose**: It abstracts the internal workings of a system, allowing programmers to use functionality without knowing the details of the underlying code.

---

### **Interpreter in Java: JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: The interpreter that executes Java bytecode. It allows Java applications to run on any platform without modification, embodying Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle.

---

### **Java Editions**

Java is categorized into three main editions, each serving different application development needs:

1. **Java Standard Edition (JSE)**:
   - **Description**: Defines the core Java language specifications and provides libraries for developing a wide range of applications, such as:
     - **Console-based applications**
     - **Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications**
     - **Network-enabled applications**
     - **Database-driven applications**
   - **Components**:
     - **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: A complete software development kit that includes the necessary tools and libraries to **develop, execute, and debug** Java applications.
     - **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: A subset of the JDK, containing libraries and tools necessary to **execute** Java applications. It allows applications to run on different platforms without needing development tools.
       - **Note**: The JRE is now part of the **Jakarta Runtime Environment**, as Java EE (Enterprise Edition) was acquired by the Eclipse Foundation.

2. **Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)**:
   - **Description**: Defines specifications for building **N-tier** (multi-layer) or **distributed applications**. JEE is used for large-scale enterprise applications that require scalability, security, and multi-tier architecture.
   - **Technologies**:
     - **Servlets**: Java classes used for handling HTTP requests and responses in web applications.
     - **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: Used for object-relational mapping (ORM) and managing database operations.
     - **Java Messaging Service (JMS)**: Provides messaging capabilities for communication between different components of a distributed system.

3. **Java Micro Edition (JME)**:
   - **Description**: Tailored for developing applications for resource-constrained devices, such as:
     - Mobile phones
     - Tablets
     - Blu-ray players
     - Set-top boxes
   - JME is optimized for devices with limited memory and processing power and was widely used for mobile applications before the rise of modern mobile operating systems.

### **Installing Java and Setting Up Eclipse IDE**

#### 1. **Download Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- Download **JDK version 8**: `jdk-8u441-windows-x64.exe` from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
- Download the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

#### 2. **Install JDK**
- During installation, set the installation path to `C:\JavaSE` (or your preferred directory).
  
#### 3. **Verify Java Installation**
After installing, verify the installation by running the following commands in the Command Prompt (CMD):
- To check the **JDK version**, type:
  ```cmd
  javac -version
  ```
- To check the **JRE version**, type:
  ```cmd
  java -version
  ```

#### 4. **Set the PATH Environment Variable**
- Add the JDK bin directory to your system’s `PATH` variable to access Java commands from anywhere in the terminal. Run the following command in CMD:
  ```cmd
  set path=C:\JavaSE\bin;%path%
  ```
  - This appends the Java installation path to the system’s environment variable temporarily. To make it permanent, follow the steps below.

#### 5. **Create and Run Your First Java Program**
- Open Notepad and write the following Java program:

  ```java
  class FirstProgram {
      public static void main(String [] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
      }
  }
  ```

- Save the file as `"FirstProgram.java"` in your working directory. Make sure to use double quotes when saving the file to avoid adding a `.txt` extension.

- Compile and run the program in CMD:
  1. Navigate to the directory where the Java file is saved.
  2. Compile the program:
     ```cmd
     javac FirstProgram.java
     ```
  3. Run the program:
     ```cmd
     java FirstProgram
     ```

#### 6. **Edit System Environment Variables**
To make the Java installation accessible globally, set the environment variables:

- **Step 1**: Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select **Properties**.
- **Step 2**: Click on **Advanced System Settings**.
- **Step 3**: In the **System Properties** window, click on **Environment Variables**.
  
**Edit the `PATH` variable:**
- Under **System Variables**, find the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
- Add a new entry: `C:\JavaSE\bin` and move it to the top of the list.

**Create a new system variable `JAVA_HOME`:**
- Click **New** under System Variables.
- Variable name: `JAVA_HOME`
- Variable value: `C:\JavaSE`

This ensures Java is set up correctly across your system.

---

### **Working with Eclipse**

- **Close Project**: Always close the project in Eclipse before exiting to ensure resources are released properly.
- **Delete Project**: When deleting a project in Eclipse, check the box for "Delete project contents on disk" if you want to remove it completely from the system.


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````


### **Memory Allocation in Java**

- **Primitive Data Types** are stored in the **stack** (local store), which is used for method execution and local variables.
- **Object Data Types** are stored in the **heap** (free store), which is used for dynamic memory allocation.

---

### **Primitive Data Types (In-built)**

Primitive data types are the most basic data types available in Java, predefined by the language. They are **not objects**:

| Data Type  | Size    | Description                                |
|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `int`      | 4 bytes | Integer values (whole numbers).            |
| `long`     | 8 bytes | Larger integer values.                     |
| `short`    | 2 bytes | Small integer values.                      |
| `float`    | 4 bytes | Single-precision floating-point numbers.   |
| `double`   | 8 bytes | Double-precision floating-point numbers.   |
| `char`     | 2 bytes | Unicode characters (supports values 0-65535). |
| `byte`     | 1 byte  | Smallest integer type, used for data streams. |
| `boolean`  | 1 bit   | Represents true or false values.           |

---

### **Object Data Types**

- **Object Data Types** are created from classes, including arrays and user-defined types. Unlike primitives, object data types reference memory in the heap.

---

### **Public Class Rule**

- If a class is declared as `public`, the file **must be saved** with the same name as the class.
- **Only one public class** is allowed per Java file.

---

### **Input Handling in Java**

- Java reads input in the form of bytes. Even for higher-level data types, input is processed as byte streams before being converted to the required format.

---

### **Arrays in Java**

In Java, arrays are treated as **objects**. You can create an array of primitive data types or objects.

**Syntax** for creating an array:
```java
int[] arr = new int[10];  // arr is a reference to an array of 10 integers
```

- Arrays in Java have a fixed size and are referenced by an object-like reference.

---

### **Java is Not Fully Object-Oriented**

- Primitive data types are **not objects** in Java, which is why Java is not considered a 100% object-oriented language.
- **Wrapper classes** are provided to convert primitive data types into objects. For example:
  ```java
  Integer tmp = new Integer(22);
  ```
  Here, `Integer` is a wrapper class that converts the primitive `int` to an object.

---

### **Comments in Java**

- **Single-line comment**: Use `//` to comment on one line.
  ```java
  // This is a single-line comment
  ```

- **Multi-line comment** (also known as block comments): Use `/* ... */` to comment on multiple lines.
  ```java
  /* 
     This is a 
     multi-line comment
  */
  ```

- **Documented comment**: Use `/** ... */` for comments that will be used to generate documentation using tools like Javadoc.
  ```java
  /**
   * This is a documented comment
   */
  ```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Byte takes input as a string
A byte in Java is an 8-bit(1 byte) signed data type. It can store values from -128 to 127.

2. Allocating objects in heap using 'new' operator
In Java, all objects are allocated in the heap memory using the new operator. For example, creating an instance of a class in the heap memory:
Example:
class Example { int a; }
Example obj = new Example(); // Allocates memory for an object in heap

3. Reference does not hold data but stores a memory address pointing to the object
A reference variable in Java does not contain the actual object but stores the memory address of where the object resides in the heap memory.
It acts as a pointer to the object.
Example:
Example anotherRef = obj; // anotherRef holds the reference to the object 'obj' points to

4. Public class (keyword) files can be used anywhere in any project
A class marked with the public keyword can be accessed from anywhere in the project or across packages.
Without the public modifier, the class has package-private access, meaning it can only be accessed by other classes in the same package.

5. Reference size is typically 4 bytes (32-bit JVM) or 8 bytes (64-bit JVM)
The size of a reference in Java depends on the architecture of the JVM.
In a 32-bit JVM, a reference typically occupies 4 bytes, while in a 64-bit JVM, the reference typically occupies 8 bytes.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Objects are stored in Heap while References and Primitive Data types are stored in Stack.
In Java, objects are always stored in the heap memory, 
whereas reference variables (which point to objects) and primitive data types (like int, char, float, etc.) are stored in the stack memory.

```````````````````

How to create an object?

Example 1 (Two-step process):

Calculator objCalculator;          // Step 1: Declare reference variable
objCalculator = new Calculator();  // Step 2: Create an object and assign it to the reference

Example 2 (Single line):

Calculator objCalculator = new Calculator();  // Declare and create an object in a single line

````````````````````````

Debugging Method

1. Set Breakpoint: Set a breakpoint where you want to pause the execution.
2. Then go to Debug Method: Begin debugging in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).
Keyboard Shortcuts in Debug Mode:

F5: Step into – Enters into the method call to debug line by line.
F6: Step over – Executes the current line and moves to the next one, skipping the method body if there is a method call.
F8: Continue – Runs the program until it hits the next breakpoint.

``````````````````````````````

What are Arrays?

An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same data type in a fixed-size sequential collection.
The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be accessed using their index.

------------------------------

Fixed array with literal/pre-defined values:

int[] arrName = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

This array has 10 elements, initialized with values from 1 to 10.

````````````````````````````````````````````

Fixed size array with no values:

int[] arrFixed = new int[15];

This creates an array of size 15.
By default, all values in the array will be initialized to 0.

`````````````````````````````````````````````

Multi-Dimensional Array

1. Matrix array (2D array):

A matrix array is a multi-dimensional array where all rows have the same number of columns.

Example:
int[][] arr = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };

It forms a matrix like this:
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
This is a 3x3 matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns.

2. Jagged array:

A jagged array is an array of arrays where each row can have a different number of columns. Example:

int[][] arr = new int[3][];
arr[0] = new int[3];  // First row with 3 columns
arr[1] = new int[5];  // Second row with 5 columns
arr[2] = new int[9];  // Third row with 9 columns

It forms a structure like this:

Row 1: [ _ _ _ ]     // 3 elements in row 1
Row 2: [ _ _ _ _ _ ] // 5 elements in row 2
Row 3: [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ] // 9 elements in row 3

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Static Variables in Java

Static variables are allocated only once in the class memory, and the same memory and value are shared across every instance of that class.
Instance variables, on the other hand, are specific to each object of the class and store different values for each instance.

`````````````````````

Default Values of Static Variables

The default value of a static variable is 0 if it is a member of the class.
However, if the static variable is local, you must explicitly initialize it because local variables don't have a default value.
Example of a static variable:

public static int variable = 9;  // This is hard-coded

The value 9 is assigned to the static variable at the time of declaration. Every instance of the class shares this same value.

```````````````````````````

Modifying Static Variables Using a Static Block

You can change the value of static variables using a static block.
A static block is executed only once, when the class is first loaded, and it can only manipulate static variables or call static methods.
Example of a static block:

static {
    variable = 20;  // Here, only static variables can be accessed or modified
}

In the above example, the static block changes the value of variable to 20.

```````````````````````````````

# Difference Between Static and Instance Variables

| Feature                     | Static Variables                             | Instance Variables                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Keyword**                  | Declared using the `static` keyword          | No `static` keyword used                     |
| **Memory Allocation**        | Allocated once per class                     | Allocated separately for each object         |
| **Shared Across Instances**  | Shared among all instances of the class      | Unique to each instance of the class         |
| **Default Value**            | Default value is `0` (for numeric types)     | Default value depends on data type (e.g., `0`, `null`) |
| **Access**                   | Can be accessed directly using the class name| Accessed through an object reference         |
| **When Loaded**              | Loaded when the class is loaded              | Created when a new object is instantiated    |
| **Use Case**                 | Useful for data shared by all instances (e.g., counters) | Useful for object-specific data (e.g., unique object properties) |
| **Lifetime**                 | Exists as long as the class is loaded        | Exists as long as the object is alive        |
| **Example**                  | `public static int staticVar = 10;`          | `public int instanceVar = 5;`                |

``````````````````````````````````

# Static, Instance Variables, and Constructors

## 1. Constructor
- A constructor is a special member function of a class that has the same name as the class.
- It is automatically called when an object of that class is created.
- Unlike methods, a constructor doesn't have a return type (not even `void`).
- You cannot call multiple constructors during the creation of a single object. However, you can call multiple static and instance variables within the constructor or methods.

Example:
class Calculator {
    int instanceVar;         // Instance variable
    static int staticVar;     // Static variable

    // Constructor - same name as the class
    public Calculator(int instanceVar) {
        this.instanceVar = instanceVar;  // Assign instance variable
        staticVar++;                     // Modify static variable
    }
    
    // Instance method
    public void displayValues() {
        System.out.println("Instance Variable: " + instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + staticVar);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating first object of Calculator class
        Calculator calc1 = new Calculator(10);
        calc1.displayValues();  // Output: Instance Variable: 10, Static Variable: 1
        
        // Creating second object of Calculator class
        Calculator calc2 = new Calculator(20);
        calc2.displayValues();  // Output: Instance Variable: 20, Static Variable: 2
    }
}

Explanation:
The constructor Calculator(int instanceVar) is called each time an object (calc1, calc2) is created.
Instance variable (instanceVar) is specific to each object, so calc1 has 10, and calc2 has 20.
Static variable (staticVar) is shared between all objects, and its value is incremented each time a new object is created.
So, calc1 has 1, and after creating calc2, the value becomes 2.

````````````````````````````````````

Static and Instance Variables, Static and Instance Functions

Static Variables (Class Variables)

Static variables are also known as class variables.
They are allocated once per class and exist regardless of the number of objects created.
These variables are directly accessible using the class name and share the same copy across the entire class.
Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded, either with a default value or a value specified by the programmer.

Instance Variables

Instance variables are allocated per object, meaning each object gets its own copy.
These variables store individual values for each object and are initialized when an object is created.

``````````````````````````````````````

Class Loading and ByteCode Execution

Every Java class, when compiled, gets converted into ByteCode.
This ByteCode is loaded into memory by the Class Loader, which is part of the JVM.

`````````````````````````````````````

Class Loader Behavior:

The class loader will load a class into memory in one of the following situations (whichever occurs first):

a. The first time a static variable or static function of the class is accessed.
b. The first time an object of the class is created.
c. The class is explicitly loaded by the program using methods like Class.forName().

``````````````````````````````````````

Static Initialization and Class Loading Process:

When a class is loaded into memory, all static variables are initialized, either with a default value or the value specified in the code.
The static initialization block (if present) is executed, allowing the class to run code during its loading phase.
Once the static variables are initialized and the static block is executed, the class is successfully loaded into program memory (ByteCode).

`````````````````````````````````````

Object Creation and Memory Allocation:

When the programmer creates an object of a class, the JVM checks if the class has already been loaded:
  If not loaded, the class loader loads the class into memory following the process mentioned above.
  If the class is already loaded, the JVM:
    Allocates memory for all instance variables of the class.
    Initializes them with default or specified values.
    Executes any initialization blocks associated with the class.
    Calls the constructor to create the object.

``````````````````````````````````````

Key Points:

Static variables and methods are shared across all objects of the class.
Instance variables and methods are specific to each object.
The class loader is responsible for loading classes into memory when needed, either by accessing static members or creating objects.
Static initialization blocks are used to execute code at the time the class is loaded.

``````````````````````````````````````

Class Loader in Java: Primordial and Object Class Loaders

The Class Loader in Java is responsible for loading Java classes into memory. It is categorized into two types:

1. Primordial Class Loader:
   - This class loader is responsible for loading pre-defined Java classes (e.g., core Java libraries such as `java.lang`, `java.util`, etc.).
   - These classes are part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and are loaded at the system level.
   - The Primordial Class Loader is considered the bootstrap loader and is the first class loader that comes into play when the JVM starts.
   
2. Object Class Loader:
   - This class loader is responsible for loading user-defined classes (i.e., classes written by the programmer).
   - It deals with the application-specific classes that are created as part of the program and are not part of the core Java libraries.
   - These classes are often loaded by custom class loaders defined within the application or by the default application class loader.
   
---

Differentiation in Bytecode:
- The Primordial and Object class loaders are differentiated by a special signature in the Bytecode.
- The Primordial Class Loader uses specific markers in the Bytecode that identify classes as part of the core Java libraries.
- The Object Class Loader uses a different set of markers to differentiate user-defined classes from predefined system classes.

--------------------------------

`==` Operator (Memory Address Comparison)

- In Java, the `==` operator checks if two references point to the same memory location.
- It does not compare the contents of the objects, but rather if the references themselves are identical.

Example:
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");

if (str1 == str2) {
    System.out.println("Both references point to the same memory location.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Different memory locations."); // This will be printed
}

if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    System.out.println("Both objects are equal in content."); // This will be printed
}
```

Explanation:
- `str1 == str2` checks if `str1` and `str2` refer to the same memory location (they don’t).
- `str1.equals(str2)` checks if the content of the two strings is the same, which it is.

---

`for-each` Loop

- The `for-each` loop in Java is used to iterate over arrays or collections like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, etc.
- It simplifies iteration without needing an index.

Example:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

Explanation:
- The `for-each` loop here iterates through each element in the `numbers` array and prints them out.
  
---

`this` Operator

- The `this` keyword refers to the current object within an instance method or constructor.
- It is commonly used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.

Example:
class Person {
    String name;

    // Constructor using 'this'
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to the instance variable, 'name' refers to the parameter
    }

    public void printName() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name); // 'this' is optional here
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice");
        person.printName(); // Output: Name: Alice
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `this.name` refers to the **instance variable**, while `name` refers to the parameter passed to the constructor.
  
---

Access Modifiers: `private`, `default`, `protected`, `public`

#### 1. `private:
- Members declared `private` are accessible only within the same class.

Example:

class Example {
    private int privateVar = 10;

    private void show() {
        System.out.println("Private method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example ex = new Example();
        // ex.privateVar and ex.show() are not accessible here because they are private.
    }
}
```

2. `default` (Package-Private):
- If no access modifier is specified, the member is **accessible within the same package**.

class Example {
    int defaultVar = 20; // Default access

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Default access");
    }
}
```

3. `protected`:
- Members declared `protected` are accessible **within the same package** and **by subclasses** in other packages.

Example:

class Parent {
    protected int protectedVar = 30;
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println(protectedVar); // Accessible due to inheritance
    }
}
```

4. `public`:
- Members declared `public` are accessible **from anywhere**.

Example:

class Example {
    public int publicVar = 40;

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Public method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example ex = new Example();
        System.out.println(ex.publicVar); // Accessible
        ex.show(); // Accessible
    }
}

### 1. **Modularity**

- **Modularity** refers to breaking down a program into **separate, independent modules** or components, each performing a specific function. It helps make code **easier to maintain, test, and reuse**.
- In Java, modularity can be achieved by organizing code into **classes** and **methods**.
- Java 9 introduced the **Java Module System** (Jigsaw Project), which allows for creating explicit **modules** and defining dependencies between them.

#### Example:

```java
// Module A: Calculator.java
package com.example.math;

public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}

// Module B: Main.java
package com.example.main;

import com.example.math.Calculator;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Calculator` class is in a separate **module** (or package), and its functionality can be reused by the `Main` class.
- Modularity allows separating different functionalities (like math operations) into independent parts.

---

### 2. **Abstraction**

- **Abstraction** refers to **hiding the complex implementation details** and exposing only the necessary parts to the user.
- It allows you to **focus on what an object does** rather than how it does it.
- In Java, abstraction can be achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

#### Example:

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (doesn't have a body)
    public abstract void sound();
    
    // Concrete method (has a body)
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

// Subclass (Concrete Class)
class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound(); // Output: Woof!
        dog.sleep(); // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The **abstract class `Animal`** provides a blueprint with the `sound()` method, which **hides the specific implementation**.
- The **`Dog` class** provides the actual implementation of `sound()`, while `sleep()` can be reused without changing the implementation.

---

### 3. **Encapsulation**

- **Encapsulation** is the concept of **wrapping the data (variables)** and **methods** that manipulate the data into a single unit, typically a **class**.
- It helps in **restricting access** to the class members using **access modifiers** (e.g., `private`, `public`).
- Encapsulation promotes **data hiding** and protects object integrity by controlling access to variables.

#### Example:

```java
class Person {
    // Private variables, only accessible within the class
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter and setter methods to access the private variables
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) { // Adding validation
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age must be positive.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Alice");
        person.setAge(25);

        System.out.println(person.getName()); // Output: Alice
        System.out.println(person.getAge());  // Output: 25
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The variables `name` and `age` are **private**, meaning they are only accessible within the `Person` class.
- The **getter and setter methods** allow controlled access to these variables, ensuring that the data is modified only in a controlled way (e.g., adding validation for age).
- **Encapsulation** helps protect sensitive data from being directly accessed or modified from outside the class.

---

### Summary:

- **Modularity**: Dividing the program into separate, independent parts (modules) to improve maintainability and reusability.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single class and restricting access to them through access modifiers (promotes data hiding).

These principles form the foundation of **object-oriented programming** (OOP) in Java, leading to better-organized, more maintainable code.

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

### **Getters and Setters in Java**

**Getters** and **Setters** are methods used to access and modify the private variables of a class. These methods are essential for **encapsulation**, which promotes **data hiding** and allows for controlled access to class variables.

- **Getter**: A method that **retrieves** the value of a private variable.
- **Setter**: A method that **sets** or updates the value of a private variable.

#### **Why Use Getters and Setters?**
1. **Encapsulation**: Keeps the internal implementation (i.e., private variables) hidden and provides controlled access through public methods.
2. **Validation**: Setters allow adding validation logic before assigning a value to the variable.
3. **Read-only / Write-only**: Getters can be provided without setters for read-only properties, and vice versa for write-only properties.

---

### **Syntax of Getter and Setter Methods**

- **Getter Method**: 
  - Syntax: `public <datatype> get<PropertyName>() { return property; }`
  - It returns the value of the private variable.
  
- **Setter Method**: 
  - Syntax: `public void set<PropertyName>(<datatype> value) { this.property = value; }`
  - It allows the user to set the value of the private variable, often with validation.

---

### **Example of Getters and Setters**

```java
class Person {
    // Private fields (encapsulated)
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {  // Validating that age is positive
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age must be a positive number.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an instance of the Person class
        Person person = new Person();

        // Using setters to set values
        person.setName("Alice");
        person.setAge(25);

        // Using getters to retrieve and display values
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName()); // Output: Name: Alice
        System.out.println("Age: " + person.getAge());   // Output: Age: 25

        // Trying to set invalid age
        person.setAge(-5); // Output: Age must be a positive number.
    }
}
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **Private Variables**: 
   - `name` and `age` are declared `private` to ensure they are not directly accessible from outside the `Person` class.
   
2. **Getter Methods**:
   - `getName()` returns the value of the `name` variable.
   - `getAge()` returns the value of the `age` variable.
   
3. **Setter Methods**:
   - `setName(String name)` allows setting a new value to the `name` variable.
   - `setAge(int age)` assigns a value to `age` but includes validation logic to ensure the value is greater than zero.

---

### **Advantages of Getters and Setters**:

1. **Data Validation**: Setters allow adding validation to prevent invalid values.
   - Example: In the above example, the `setAge()` method ensures that the age cannot be negative.
   
2. **Control Access**: You can control how a variable is accessed and modified.
   - Example: You could make the variable read-only by providing a getter without a setter.
   
3. **Maintainability**: Any changes to how data is accessed or modified can be done in one place without affecting the rest of the code.

---

### **Customizing Getters and Setters**

You can also customize getters and setters as per your need. For example, adding a **read-only** property:

#### Read-Only Property Example:
```java
class ReadOnlyPerson {
    private String name;
    
    public ReadOnlyPerson(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Only a getter is provided, so 'name' is read-only
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReadOnlyPerson person = new ReadOnlyPerson("Bob");
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.getName()); // Output: Name: Bob
        // person.setName("Alice"); // Not allowed, no setter method available.
    }
}
```

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Getters and Setters** provide a way to **access and modify** private class members in a controlled manner.
- They promote **encapsulation** by hiding the internal implementation details and allowing only controlled access.

### **Abstraction is Generalization**

**Abstraction** refers to focusing on the **essential characteristics** of an object rather than the specific details. It allows for **generalization** by hiding unnecessary complexities and exposing only what is important.

- In Java, **abstract classes** and **interfaces** are used to implement abstraction.

#### Example of Abstraction (Generalization):

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method
    public abstract void sound();
    
    // Generalized method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

// Concrete class (specific implementation)
class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Barks!");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meows!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound(); // Output: Barks!

        Animal cat = new Cat();
        cat.sound(); // Output: Meows!
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Animal` class represents a **generalized concept** of an animal with the abstract `sound()` method.
- Specific animals like `Dog` and `Cat` provide their specialized implementation of the `sound()` method.

---

### **Inheritance is Specialization**

**Inheritance** in Java allows one class (child) to **specialize** by inheriting properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent). The child class can add its specific features or **override** existing ones, making it more specialized.

#### Example of Inheritance (Specialization):

```java
class Vehicle {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("The vehicle is moving.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("The car is honking.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.move(); // Output: The vehicle is moving.
        car.honk(); // Output: The car is honking.
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Car` class **inherits** the `move()` method from the `Vehicle` class.
- The `Car` class also **specializes** by adding the `honk()` method.

---

### **Wrapper Classes: Making Java 100% Object-Oriented**

Java is not considered **100% object-oriented** due to the presence of **primitive data types** (`int`, `char`, `double`, etc.). To overcome this, Java provides **wrapper classes** for each primitive type, allowing them to be treated as **objects**.

#### Wrapper Classes:
- `int` → `Integer`
- `char` → `Character`
- `double` → `Double`

By using wrapper classes, Java allows primitive values to be used in object-oriented contexts (e.g., in collections like `ArrayList`).

#### Example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int primitiveValue = 5;

        // Using a wrapper class to convert primitive to an object
        Integer wrappedValue = Integer.valueOf(primitiveValue);

        System.out.println("Primitive value: " + primitiveValue);   // Output: 5
        System.out.println("Wrapped value: " + wrappedValue);       // Output: 5
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The primitive `int` is **wrapped** inside an `Integer` object, making it usable in object-oriented constructs like collections (`ArrayList<Integer>`, etc.).

---

### **Where Can Data Types Be Initialized?**

In Java, variables can be initialized in different places:

1. **Initialization during Declaration**:
   - You can assign a value when declaring the variable.

   ```java
   int x = 10;
   ```

2. **Initialization in a Constructor**:
   - Variables can be initialized in a class constructor.

   ```java
   class Person {
       int age;

       // Constructor
       public Person(int age) {
           this.age = age;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Initialization in Methods**:
   - Variables can also be initialized inside methods.

   ```java
   public void setAge(int age) {
       this.age = age;
   }
   ```

---

### **Default Constructor (Zero-Arg Constructor)**

- The **default constructor** (also called a **zero-argument constructor**) is provided by the **compiler** if no other constructor is explicitly defined in the class.
- It does not take any arguments and simply assigns default values to instance variables.

#### Example:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Default constructor provided by the compiler
    Person() {
        // Empty constructor body (does nothing)
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();  // Calls the default constructor
        System.out.println(p.name);  // Output: null
        System.out.println(p.age);   // Output: 0
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- When no constructor is explicitly defined, the compiler provides a **default constructor** that assigns default values (`null` for objects, `0` for numeric types) to instance variables.

---

### **Constructors**

A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is called **every time an object is created**. It is used to initialize the object's state.

- **Constructors** have the same name as the class and **do not have a return type**.
- **Types of Constructors**:
  1. **Default Constructor**: Provided by the compiler or explicitly declared with no arguments.
  2. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize variables.

#### Example of Parameterized Constructor:

```java
class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
        System.out.println(car.model);  // Output: Toyota
        System.out.println(car.year);   // Output: 2020
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Car` class has a **parameterized constructor** that allows the user to pass values when creating an object. These values are used to initialize the `model` and `year` variables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Inheritance in Java**

Inheritance allows one class to **inherit** fields and methods from another class, enabling **reuse of code** and the creation of a more organized and modular system. It also promotes the concept of **specialization**, where the child class can extend or override the functionality of the parent class.

---

### **Types of Inheritance in Java**

1. **Single Inheritance**
2. **Multi-level Inheritance**
3. **Multiple Inheritance (Supported through interfaces, not through classes)**
4. **Hybrid Inheritance (Supported partially with interfaces)**

---

### **1. Single Inheritance**

In **single inheritance**, one class (child) inherits from a single parent class.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal class
        dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog class
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, gaining access to its `eat()` method.
- This is **single inheritance**, where one class inherits from one parent.

---

### **2. Multi-Level Inheritance**

In **multi-level inheritance**, a class is derived from another class, which is also derived from another class (forming a chain of inheritance).

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Walking...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
        dog.walk();  // Inherited from Mammal
        dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Dog` class inherits from `Mammal`, and `Mammal` inherits from `Animal`.
- The class chain shows **multi-level inheritance**, where each class can access the methods of its parent and grandparent classes.

---

### **3. Multiple Inheritance (Not Supported for Classes, Only through Interfaces)**

Java **does not support multiple inheritance** for classes to avoid ambiguity and complexity. However, it supports **multiple inheritance through interfaces**.

#### Reason: **Ambiguity**

Consider this situation where multiple classes have the same method, and a subclass inherits both of these classes:

```java
class A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// If Java allowed multiple inheritance, this would create ambiguity in the subclass C
// class C extends A, B { } // Which display() method would be inherited by C?
```

This would cause ambiguity as the compiler wouldn't know which version of the `display()` method to inherit. This is why **multiple inheritance** is not supported for classes.

---


### **4. Hybrid Inheritance (Supported through Interfaces, Not Classes)**

**Hybrid inheritance** is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. Since **multiple inheritance** is not supported for classes (due to ambiguity), hybrid inheritance involving multiple classes is **not supported** in Java. However, **hybrid inheritance can be achieved with interfaces**.

---

### **All Classes in Java are Inherited from the `Object` Class**

In Java, every class, whether defined by the user or a library class, implicitly inherits from the **`Object` class** if no other superclass is specified. This means that the `Object` class is the **parent** of all classes in Java.

The `Object` class provides some essential methods like:

- `toString()`
- `equals()`
- `hashCode()`
- `clone()`
- `getClass()`

#### Example:

```java
class CustomClass {
    int id;

    public CustomClass(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Overriding the toString() method from the Object class
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "CustomClass ID: " + id;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomClass obj = new CustomClass(101);
        System.out.println(obj.toString());  // Output: CustomClass ID: 101
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Since `CustomClass` does not explicitly extend any class, it implicitly inherits from the `Object` class.
- The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of the object.

---

### **Summary of Inheritance Types in Java**:

| Inheritance Type      | Description                                        | Supported in Java |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Single Inheritance** | One class inherits from a single parent class.     | Yes               |
| **Multi-Level**        | A class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from a class (chain). | Yes |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | A class inherits from multiple classes (creates ambiguity). | No (Only through interfaces) |
| **Hybrid Inheritance** | Combination of different types of inheritance.     | Yes (through interfaces) |

---

### **Conclusion**:

- Java supports **single** and **multi-level** inheritance with classes.
- **Multiple inheritance** is not allowed with classes due to ambiguity, but it is supported through **interfaces**.
- Every class in Java is a subclass of the **`Object` class**, which provides fundamental methods like `toString()` and `equals()`.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

### **Java Compiler Overview**

The **compiler** in Java is responsible for transforming the code you write into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Along with this, the compiler performs several important checks and operations to ensure the correctness of your program, such as **type checking** and **type casting**.

---

### **Type Checking**

**Type checking** ensures that **the type of the right-hand side (RHS) expression is compatible with the left-hand side (LHS)**, ensuring that only valid types are assigned to variables.

#### Example:

```java
int number = 10; // Correct: RHS (int) can be assigned to LHS (int)

String str = 10; // Error: Type mismatch, RHS (int) cannot be assigned to LHS (String)
```

The compiler performs **type checking** to prevent errors due to incompatible types. In Java, types must be compatible for assignment; otherwise, the program will not compile.

---

### **Type Casting**

**Type casting** is a process of converting one data type into another.

#### **Types of Type Casting**:

1. **Implicit Casting (Widening)**: Automatically converting a smaller data type to a larger one.
2. **Explicit Casting (Narrowing)**: Manually converting a larger data type to a smaller one.

#### **Example:**

```java
// Implicit Casting (Widening) - automatic conversion from smaller to larger type
int num = 100;
double value = num; // int (num) is converted to double automatically (Implicit)

// Explicit Casting (Narrowing) - requires manual conversion from larger to smaller type
double decimalValue = 45.7;
int intValue = (int) decimalValue; // decimalValue is explicitly cast to int
```

In the example above:
- **Implicit Casting** happens when a smaller type is automatically converted to a larger one.
- **Explicit Casting** happens when we convert a larger type to a smaller one using a cast operator `(type)`.

---

### **Upcasting and Downcasting**

These are types of **object type casting** used in inheritance hierarchies when dealing with **base and derived classes**.

#### **Upcasting**

**Upcasting** refers to casting a derived class object (child) to a base class type (parent). This is done **implicitly** by Java because a child class object "is-a" parent class object.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Animal animal = dog; // Upcasting (implicit)
        animal.makeSound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Upcasting** is done **implicitly** because the `Dog` class is a subtype of `Animal`. The `animal` reference points to a `Dog` object.
- The **base type (Animal)** can hold a reference to its **derived type (Dog)**.

---

#### **Downcasting**

**Downcasting** is the opposite of upcasting, where you cast a base class reference (parent) back to a derived class (child). This requires **explicit casting** because the base class object **may not always be a derived class object**.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting (implicit)
        Dog dog = (Dog) animal;    // Downcasting (explicit)
        dog.bark();                // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Downcasting** must be **explicitly** done using `(type)` because the compiler cannot guarantee that the base class reference refers to a derived class object.
- If `animal` was not a `Dog`, downcasting would throw a **ClassCastException**.

---

### **Boxing and Unboxing**

Boxing and unboxing deal with the **conversion between primitive types and their wrapper classes**.

- **Boxing**: Converting a **primitive type** to its **wrapper class** (e.g., `int` to `Integer`).
- **Unboxing**: Converting a **wrapper class** object to its **primitive type** (e.g., `Integer` to `int`).

---

#### **Boxing (Manual and Auto-Boxing)**

```java
// Manual Boxing
int primitiveValue = 100;
Integer boxedValue = Integer.valueOf(primitiveValue); // Boxing

// Auto-Boxing (Automatic conversion)
Integer autoBoxedValue = primitiveValue; // Auto-Boxing
```

- **Boxing**: The primitive value `100` is manually converted to the wrapper class `Integer`.
- **Auto-Boxing**: The conversion happens automatically when assigning a primitive value to an `Integer` reference.

---

#### **Unboxing (Manual and Auto-Unboxing)**

```java
// Manual Unboxing
Integer integerObject = new Integer(500);
int unboxedValue = integerObject.intValue(); // Unboxing

// Auto-Unboxing (Automatic conversion)
int autoUnboxedValue = integerObject; // Auto-Unboxing
```

- **Unboxing**: The `Integer` object is manually converted back to a primitive `int`.
- **Auto-Unboxing**: The unboxing happens automatically when assigning an `Integer` object to a primitive type.

---

### **Implicit Upcast**

An **implicit upcast** occurs when a derived class object is automatically assigned to a base class reference without requiring explicit casting.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat cat = new Cat();
        Animal animal = cat; // Implicit upcast from Cat to Animal
        animal.sound();      // Output: Cat meows (calls the overridden method)
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Since `Cat` is a subclass of `Animal`, assigning a `Cat` object to an `Animal` reference is done implicitly without the need for casting.
- The `sound()` method in `Cat` is called even though the reference is of type `Animal`.

---

### **Summary of Key Concepts**

| Concept                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type Checking**       | Ensures the type on the RHS matches or is compatible with the type on the LHS. |
| **Implicit Casting**    | Automatically converts smaller types to larger types.                         |
| **Explicit Casting**    | Requires explicit conversion of larger types to smaller types.                |
| **Upcasting**           | Casting a derived class object to a base class reference (Implicit).          |
| **Downcasting**         | Casting a base class reference to a derived class object (Explicit).          |
| **Boxing**              | Converting a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class.               |
| **Unboxing**            | Converting a wrapper class object to its corresponding primitive type.        |
| **Auto-Boxing**         | Automatic conversion of a primitive type to a wrapper class.                  |
| **Auto-Unboxing**       | Automatic conversion of a wrapper class to a primitive type.                  |
| **Implicit Upcast**     | Automatic casting of a derived class to its base class without explicit cast. |

---

These key concepts, especially **type checking**, **casting**, and **boxing/unboxing**, play a crucial role in ensuring data type safety and flexibility in Java programming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Virtual Function Table (V-Table) in Java

- Java uses **Virtual Function Table (V-Table)** for implementing **runtime polymorphism**.  
- When a method is marked `virtual` or overridden in Java, the JVM creates a V-Table to resolve the actual method to call at runtime.
- **V-Table** holds the memory addresses of overridden methods for runtime lookup.

**Key Points:**
- Methods that are overridden in a subclass are dynamically bound using the V-Table.
- This allows Java to support runtime polymorphism, where the method called depends on the actual object, not the reference type.

---

### Annotations in Java: `@Override`

- The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is overriding a method from a superclass.
- It ensures that the method signature matches the superclass method, and prevents mistakes.

#### Example:

```java
class Base {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Base class show");
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Derived class show");
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `@Override` annotation ensures that the `show()` method in `Derived` is indeed overriding the one in `Base`.

---

### **Abstract Class in Java**

- An **abstract class** in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is used to define common behavior that other classes will inherit.
- **Abstract methods** are methods without a body and must be implemented by the subclass.
- **Abstract classes** are similar to **pure virtual functions in C++**.

#### Example:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method
    public abstract void sound();
    
    // Concrete method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal is sleeping");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class, and the `sound()` method is abstract, meaning it must be implemented by any subclass, like `Dog`.

---

### **Final Keyword in Java**

The **final** keyword is used to apply restrictions on:
- **Variables**: The value cannot be changed (like constants).
- **Methods**: The method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **Classes**: The class cannot be extended by other classes.

#### Example:

1. **Final Variable:**
   ```java
   public final int MAX_VALUE = 100; // Constant
   ```

2. **Final Method:**
   ```java
   public final void display() {
       System.out.println("This method cannot be overridden");
   }
   ```

3. **Final Class:**
   ```java
   public final class FinalClass {
       // This class cannot be extended
   }
   ```

**Key Points:**
- **Final variables** cannot be reassigned.
- **Final methods** cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **Final classes** cannot be subclassed.

---

### **Super Keyword**

- The `super` keyword in Java refers to the **base class** and is used to access members of the base class.
- It is often used to:
  - **Call a superclass constructor**.
  - **Access superclass methods or variables** that are hidden by the subclass.

#### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Calls the method from the base class (Animal)
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**Key Point**:
- When used inside a constructor, `super()` **must be the first statement** to ensure the superclass constructor is invoked.

---

### **Final vs Constant in Java**

- **Final variables**: Once initialized, their value cannot change.  
  Example: `final int MAX = 10;`
- **Constant variables**: Are final variables that are static, meaning they are shared across all instances of the class and are initialized only once.

#### Example:

```java
public class Constants {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;  // Constant value
}
```

- `PI` is a constant, and its value cannot be changed anywhere in the program.

---

### **Abstract Classes for Repeated Code**

When certain functionalities or methods are repeated across multiple subclasses, an **abstract class** can be used to centralize the common code, and the subclasses can implement the abstract methods as per their specific behavior.

#### Example:

```java
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void draw(); // Abstract method
    public void commonOperation() {
        System.out.println("This is a common operation for all shapes.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class contains a common operation, and each subclass implements the `draw()` method differently.

---

### **Summary of Concepts**

| **Concept**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Virtual Function Table (V-Table)** | Used for runtime method dispatch and supports polymorphism by holding addresses of overridden methods.                                                    |
| **@Override**                    | Ensures that a method is correctly overriding a superclass method.                                                                                         |
| **Abstract Class**               | Cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Similar to pure virtual functions in C++.                      |
| **Final Keyword**                | Prevents modification of variables, methods, and classes (cannot change value, cannot override, cannot extend).                                             |
| **Super Keyword**                | Refers to the superclass and is used to invoke methods or constructors of the base class. Must be the first statement when used inside a constructor.        |
| **Abstract for Repeated Code**   | Abstract classes help to avoid repetition by centralizing common code, while specific functionality is defined in subclasses.                                |

By using **abstract classes** and the **final** and **super** keywords, Java promotes **code reuse** and helps to ensure that certain behaviors cannot be altered or overridden.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a polymorphism interview, it's crucial to emphasize **overriding** and not confuse it with "overwriting" because the two terms have very different meanings, especially in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP) like Java.

### **Overriding** vs. **Overwriting**:

1. **Overriding** is an OOP concept, whereas **overwriting** refers to replacing data or content in memory, which is unrelated to method behavior in programming.

2. **Overriding** happens in the context of **inheritance**. When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, it's called method overriding. The new method overrides the behavior of the superclass method when invoked on an instance of the subclass.

   - **Example** of overriding:
     ```java
     class Animal {
         public void sound() {
             System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
         }
     }

     class Dog extends Animal {
         @Override
         public void sound() {
             System.out.println("Bark");
         }
     }

     public class TestPolymorphism {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Animal a = new Dog();  // Animal reference, but Dog object
             a.sound();  // Calls the overridden method in Dog, prints "Bark"
         }
     }
     ```
     Here, the `sound()` method in the `Dog` class **overrides** the `sound()` method in the `Animal` class. This is the key concept of **polymorphism**.

   - Overriding allows dynamic method dispatch, where the correct method is chosen at runtime based on the actual object's type (in this case, `Dog`), even though the reference type is `Animal`.

3. **Overwriting** refers to replacing data, usually in the context of memory or storage:
   - **Overwriting** would involve replacing the content of a variable, a file, or a data structure with new data, typically resulting in the loss of the original data.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int x = 10;
     x = 20; // Overwrites the value of x
     ```
     Here, the original value `10` is replaced with `20`. This is **not** related to polymorphism or method overriding.

### Why Focus on **Overriding** in an Interview?
1. **Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding**: 
   Overriding is central to polymorphism, a core principle in OOP, where a subclass can define its own unique behavior while still inheriting from the parent class. This allows for dynamic method dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type, not its reference type.

2. **Interview Relevance**: 
   When discussing polymorphism in an interview, you are primarily expected to demonstrate your understanding of how **overriding** enables subclasses to customize or extend base class behavior without altering the base class itself. This is crucial in designing flexible, maintainable, and reusable software.

3. **Avoiding Miscommunication**: 
   Using the term "overwriting" instead of "overriding" could cause confusion and reflect a misunderstanding of core OOP concepts. Overwriting implies replacing existing data, which is not the intended idea when explaining polymorphism. Overriding is about behavior, not memory or data replacement.

In conclusion, overriding is a key aspect of polymorphism and OOP, and it's important to distinguish it from overwriting to avoid confusion and demonstrate a clear understanding of inheritance and dynamic method behavior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### **`instanceof` Operator**

- **How `instanceof` works**:  
  The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or a subclass. It returns `true` if the object is a direct instance or an instance of a subclass of the given type. It essentially matches the **memory address** that the **virtual table** (vtable) is pointing to for the object's class hierarchy.

  - **Syntax**: 
    ```java
    if (object instanceof ClassName) {
        // Code if true
    }
    ```

- **Hierarchy Generalization**:  
  When you move **up the class hierarchy**, you **generalize** more. For example, a `Dog` is an instance of both `Dog` and its superclass `Animal`, but an `Animal` may not always be a `Dog`.

---

### **`StringBuffer`**

- **Why is `StringBuffer` used?**  
  `StringBuffer` is used for creating and manipulating strings **dynamically**. Unlike `String`, `StringBuffer` objects can be modified (mutable). It is particularly useful for cases where **multiple string modifications** are required without creating new objects.

  - Example:
    ```java
    StringBuffer obj = new StringBuffer("Hello");
    obj.append(" World");
    ```

- **What happens if we print a `StringBuffer` object directly?**  
  If you print an object without a proper `toString()` method, Java internally calls the default `toString()` method from the `Object` class, which prints the **class name** followed by the **hash code** of the object (something like `StringBuffer@15db9742`).

- **`toString()` method in `StringBuffer`**:  
  `StringBuffer` **overrides** the `toString()` method to return the **contents** of the string buffer. So, when you print a `StringBuffer` object, it returns the actual string value stored in it.

  - **Do we need to use `toString()` when working with `StringBuffer`?**  
    No, you don’t need to explicitly call `toString()` because it is **implicitly** called when the `StringBuffer` object is printed.

    Example:
    ```java
    StringBuffer obj = new StringBuffer("Hello");
    System.out.println(obj);  // No need to call toString() explicitly
    ```

---

### **Packages in Java**

- **Package Installation**:  
  When creating a Java file, you can define which package it belongs to by adding a **package statement** at the **beginning** of the file:
  ```java
  package com.myapp;
  ```

- **`include` vs `import`**:
  - Java uses **`import`** to include classes or entire packages for use in a program. 
  - Unlike C or C++, where you use `#include` to include files, in Java, you use `import` to reference external classes from other packages.

  - **Best practice**:  
    Use `import packageName.*;` to include **all classes** from a package instead of specifying individual class names.

- **Organizing imports in Eclipse**:  
  - Shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + O` to automatically **organize imports** in Eclipse, removing unused ones and adding required imports.

---

### **Access Specifiers in Java**

Access specifiers define the **visibility** of classes, methods, and variables. They determine where these can be accessed in the program.

#### **Types of Access Specifiers**:
1. **Public**: Accessible from **anywhere** in the application.
2. **Protected**: Accessible within the **same package** and by **subclasses** (even in different packages).
3. **Default** (no modifier): Accessible only within the **same package**.
4. **Private**: Accessible only within the **same class**.

#### **Priority Criteria**:
- **Protected** members are accessible in:
  - The **same package**, or
  - **Inherited classes** (even from different packages).

#### **Table of Access Specifiers Accessibility**:

| Access Specifier | Same Package | Different Package (Not Inherited) | Different Package (Inherited) |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `public`         | Yes          | Yes                                | Yes                           |
| `protected`      | Yes          | No                                 | Yes                           |
| Default (no modifier) | Yes      | No                                 | No                            |
| `private`        | No           | No                                 | No                            |

---

### **Refactoring in Eclipse**

- To **rename** a package or a function:
  - Right-click on the package or function in Eclipse.
  - Select **Refactor** -> **Rename**.
  - Eclipse will automatically reflect the changes in all related files.

- **Ctrl + Shift + L**: Displays a **list of all shortcut commands** available in Eclipse IDE, making development faster and easier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Linked List**

A **linked list** is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains two elements:
1. **Data**: The actual value of the node.
2. **Reference**: A pointer to the next node in the list.

Each node points to the **next node** in the sequence, forming a chain. The last node's reference points to **null**, indicating the end of the list.

#### **Textual Diagrammatic Representation** of a Singly Linked List:

```
[ Data | Next ] -> [ Data | Next ] -> [ Data | Next ] -> null
```

Example with integers:
```
[ 10 | * ] -> [ 20 | * ] -> [ 30 | * ] -> null
```

In this structure:
- Each node stores a **data value** (e.g., `10`, `20`, `30`) and a **reference** (denoted as `*`) to the next node in the list.
- The last node points to **null**, marking the end of the list.

---

### **Doubly Linked List**

A **doubly linked list** is a type of linked list where each node contains **three components**:
1. **Data**: The actual value stored in the node.
2. **Next Reference**: A pointer to the next node in the list.
3. **Previous Reference**: A pointer to the previous node in the list.

In contrast to a **singly linked list**, where each node points only to the next node, a doubly linked list allows for **traversal in both directions** (forward and backward) because each node holds a reference to both the next and previous nodes.

#### **Textual Diagrammatic Representation** of a Doubly Linked List:

```
null <- [ Prev | Data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | Data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | Data | Next ] -> null
```

Example with integers:
```
null <- [ null | 10 | * ] <-> [ * | 20 | * ] <-> [ * | 30 | null ] -> null
```

In this representation:
- Each node contains:
  - A **data value** (e.g., `10`, `20`, `30`).
  - A **previous reference** (`Prev`) pointing to the previous node.
  - A **next reference** (`Next`) pointing to the next node.
- The **first node's previous reference** points to `null` since it is the beginning of the list.
- The **last node's next reference** points to `null` indicating the end of the list.

#### **Advantages of a Doubly Linked List**:
1. **Bidirectional Traversal**: You can traverse the list in both directions (forward and backward), which is not possible with a singly linked list.
2. **Efficient Node Deletion**: In a doubly linked list, deleting a node is easier as you have direct access to the previous node.

#### **Example Code for Doubly Linked List Node in Java**:
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node prev;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }
}
```

### **Comparison: Singly Linked List vs. Doubly Linked List**

| Feature                 | Singly Linked List                            | Doubly Linked List                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of References** | One (Next)                                     | Two (Next and Previous)                        |
| **Traversal**            | Only forward traversal is possible             | Both forward and backward traversal is possible|
| **Memory Usage**         | Less memory (since each node has only one reference) | More memory (due to two references per node)    |
| **Node Deletion**        | Deletion requires more time (as previous node must be tracked manually) | Deletion is easier (as you have direct access to the previous node) |

### **Exception Handling in Java**

In Java, exceptions are **unexpected runtime events** that can potentially disrupt the normal flow of a program. Java provides a robust **exception handling mechanism** that helps manage and respond to such runtime errors.

- All exceptions are derived from the **`java.lang.Throwable`** class.
  
  **Two main categories of exceptions**:
  1. **Checked Exceptions**
  2. **Unchecked Exceptions**

#### **Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Unchecked exceptions** are not checked by the compiler, which means the programmer is not forced to handle them.
- These exceptions are typically caused by programming errors such as incorrect logic.

  Common unchecked exceptions:
  - **`NullPointerException`**: Thrown when an application attempts to use `null` where an object is required.
  - **`ClassCastException`**: Thrown when an object is forcibly cast to an incompatible class.
  - **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`**: Thrown when accessing an array with an invalid index.

#### **Checked Exceptions**
- **Checked exceptions** must be either **caught** or **declared** in the method signature using `throws`. If not handled properly, the program will not compile.
  
  Common checked exceptions:
  - **`IOException`**: Occurs when there is an I/O operation failure.
  - **`SQLException`**: Occurs when there is a failure in database operations.
  - **`ClassNotFoundException`**: Thrown when an application tries to load a class at runtime that cannot be found.

---

### **Java Exception Handling Mechanism**

Java provides a structured way to handle exceptions using **five key commands**: `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`.

1. **try**:  
   The `try` block encloses code that may potentially raise an exception. If an exception occurs, control is passed to the corresponding `catch` block.

   Example:
   ```java
   try {
       int result = 10 / 0;  // This will raise an exception
   } 
   ```

2. **catch**:  
   The `catch` block contains the code to handle exceptions. When an exception is raised in the `try` block, it is caught here, and the program can take appropriate action.

   Example:
   ```java
   catch (ArithmeticException e) {
       System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
   }
   ```

3. **throw**:  
   The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from the code. This is useful when custom conditions trigger an exception that can be thrown using `throw`.

   Example:
   ```java
   if (age < 0) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
   }
   ```

4. **throws**:  
   The `throws` keyword is used in the **method declaration** to specify that a method can throw one or more exceptions. This serves as a warning to the calling code that an exception may occur.

   Example:
   ```java
   public void readFile() throws IOException {
       // Code to read a file
   }
   ```

5. **finally**:  
   The `finally` block contains code that will execute **whether an exception occurs or not**. It is often used for resource cleanup, such as closing files or database connections.

   Example:
   ```java
   finally {
       System.out.println("Cleanup code executes here");
   }
   ```

#### **Example of Exception Handling:**
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[3]);  // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index is out of bounds!");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This block will always execute");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary of Exception Handling Commands:**

- **`try`**: Wraps the code that may throw an exception.
- **`catch`**: Catches and handles the exception thrown from the `try` block.
- **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- **`throws`**: Declares that a method may throw exceptions.
- **`finally`**: Executes code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

### **Shortcuts in Java Eclipse**

1. **Alt + Shift + S, then R**:
   - This shortcut in Eclipse is used to **generate getter and setter methods** for class fields (also known as properties).
   - **Getters** retrieve the value of a field.
   - **Setters** allow modification of the value of a field.

   Example of Getter and Setter:
   ```java
   private int age;

   public int getAge() {
       return age;
   }

   public void setAge(int age) {
       this.age = age;
   }
   ```

2. **Alt + Shift + Z**:
   - This shortcut is used to **surround code with a try-catch block** for **exception handling**.
   - This allows you to quickly add exception handling around potentially error-prone code.

### **Exception Handling Hierarchy in Java**

Java provides a hierarchy of classes that help in identifying the **nature of exceptions**. All exception-related classes are part of the **`java.lang`** package. The core structure of exception classes in Java is as follows:

```
java.lang.Throwable
    |
    +--> Error
    |    (Unrecoverable, system-level errors)
    |
    +--> Exception
         (Recoverable, application-level exceptions)
```

1. **Error**:
   - **Errors** represent serious issues that occur during the execution of a program, typically related to the environment in which the application is running.
   - These are **system-level issues** and are not intended to be caught or handled by typical applications.
   - Examples:
     - **`OutOfMemoryError`**: Raised when the JVM runs out of memory and cannot allocate more.
     - **`StackOverflowError`**: Raised when the stack size is exceeded due to deep or infinite recursion.
   - Even if an error is caught, **the programmer may not be able to take meaningful action** to recover from it.

2. **Exception**:
   - **Exceptions** are events that occur during the program's execution that can disrupt the normal flow of instructions.
   - Exceptions are typically related to **application logic errors** and can be **caught** and **handled** by the program.

#### **Types of Exceptions**:

- **Checked Exceptions**:
  - These exceptions are **checked at compile time**.
  - The compiler forces the programmer to either handle these exceptions using a try-catch block or declare them in the method using the `throws` keyword.
  - Examples:
    - **`IOException`**: Occurs when there are I/O operation failures (e.g., reading a file that doesn't exist).
    - **`SQLException`**: Occurs when there is an issue in database operations.
  - **Important Note**: Any statement that raises a checked exception **must be handled**.

  Example of checked exception handling:
  ```java
  try {
      FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("test.txt");
  } catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println("File not found!");
  }
  ```

- **Unchecked Exceptions**:
  - These exceptions are **not checked at compile time**, meaning the programmer is not forced to handle them.
  - They typically arise due to programming errors such as **logic flaws** or **incorrect use of APIs**.
  - Examples:
    - **`NullPointerException`**: Thrown when an application attempts to use `null` where an object is required.
    - **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`**: Thrown when an attempt is made to access an array with an invalid index.
  - **Unchecked exceptions** may or may not be handled by the programmer.

  Example of unchecked exception:
  ```java
  int[] arr = new int[3];
  System.out.println(arr[5]); // This will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
  ```

---

### **Error vs. Exception**

- **Error**:
  - Errors represent issues that are typically out of the programmer's control.
  - **Example**: An out-of-memory error caused by JVM failing to allocate memory, which the programmer can’t easily handle.

- **Exception**:
  - Exceptions represent issues that can be handled and recovered from by the programmer.
  - **Example**: An `IOException` when trying to read a file that does not exist.

---

### **Summary of Exception Types**:

| Type                 | Checked/Unchecked | When It Occurs                  | Can It Be Handled? |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Error**             | N/A               | System-level issues like out of memory, stack overflow | Hard to recover from |
| **Checked Exception** | Checked           | Compile-time, must be handled by programmer | Yes |
| **Unchecked Exception** | Unchecked        | Runtime, may or may not be handled by programmer | Yes |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Exception Handling in Java**

- **`printStackTrace()`**: 
  - A method that prints the **stack trace** of the exception to the standard error stream. This helps in debugging by showing the method call sequence that led to the exception.
  
- **Raising an Exception**: 
  - Use the `throw` keyword to **raise an exception** when a certain condition is met.
    ```java
    throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero");
    ```

- **Handling an Exception**: 
  - Use the `catch` block to **handle exceptions** that arise from a `try` block.
    ```java
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Caught an ArithmeticException: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```

- **Exception Handling Order**: 
  - **Always handle exceptions from the derived (specific) classes to the base (general) classes**. 
  - Since `Exception` is the **base class**, more specific exceptions like `ArithmeticException` or `NullPointerException` should be handled before it.

    Example:
    ```java
    try {
        // code
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // handle specific exception first
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // handle base exception next
    }
    ```

- **`try-catch` and `try-finally` Blocks**: 
  - A `try` block must be followed by either a `catch` block or a `finally` block (or both).
  
- **Nested try-catch**: 
  - You can nest one `try-catch` block inside another. This allows for more granular control of exception handling.

- **User-defined Exceptions**: 
  - You can create custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class.
    ```java
    class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
        public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
            super(message);
        }
    }
    ```

---

### **Generics in Java**

- **Generics** (also known as **Templates** in C++) allow you to define **classes, interfaces, and methods** that can operate on **any type of data** without specifying the exact data type until the class is instantiated.
  
  Example of a Generic Class:
  ```java
  class Box<T> {
      private T value;

      public void set(T value) {
          this.value = value;
      }

      public T get() {
          return value;
      }
  }
  ```

  - Here, `T` is a placeholder for the datatype, and when you create an instance, you specify the type:
    ```java
    Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
    intBox.set(123);
    ```

---

### **File System in Java**

- **Check if a Path is a File or Directory**:
  - Use the `File` class in Java to check whether a path represents a file or a directory.
    ```java
    File file = new File("path/to/file");
    
    if (file.isDirectory()) {
        System.out.println("It is a directory.");
    } else if (file.isFile()) {
        System.out.println("It is a file.");
    }
    ```

---

### **Input and Output Streams in Java**

- **InputStream** and **OutputStream** are abstract classes in Java used to read and write data.
  
- **OutputStream**:
  - Examples: **`FileOutputStream`**, **`DataOutputStream`**.
  - Used to write data to files or other output destinations.

- **InputStream**:
  - Examples: **`FileInputStream`**, **`Scanner`** (for reading input).

---

### **Writing and Reading from a File**

- **Writing to a File**:
    In Java, you can write data to a file using `FileOutputStream` and `DataOutputStream`. The `FileOutputStream` allows writing raw byte data, and `DataOutputStream` provides methods to write primitive data types (such as `int`, `float`, etc.) in a platform-independent way.

    - **Code Breakdown**:
      ```java
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt"); // Opens or creates the file "output.txt"
      DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(fos); // Wraps FileOutputStream to write primitive data types
      ```
      - `fos.write()`: writes data in raw byte format.
      - `dos.writeInt(25)`: Writes an `int` value (25) to the file.
      - `dos.writeUTF("Hello World")`: Writes a `String` in **UTF format** to the file.

      Always remember to **close** both streams after writing to the file using `close()`, which releases system resources associated with the file:
      ```java
      dos.close();
      fos.close();
      ```

- **Reading from a File**:
    You can read data from a file using `FileInputStream` and `DataInputStream`. While `FileInputStream` reads the raw byte data, `DataInputStream` helps to read primitive data types in the same format as written.

    - **Code Breakdown**:
      ```java
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("output.txt"); // Opens the file for reading
      DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(fis); // Wraps FileInputStream to read primitive data types
      ```
      - `dis.readInt()`: Reads an `int` from the file (in this case, 25).
      - `dis.readUTF()`: Reads a `String` in **UTF format** from the file (in this case, "Hello World").

      As with writing, it is essential to close the streams to avoid resource leaks:
      ```java
      dis.close();
      fis.close();
      ```

- **Important Note**: 
    The **sequence of reading and writing must be the same**. This means that if you write an `int` followed by a `String`, you need to read the `int` first and then the `String`. If the order is mismatched, the reading process can result in errors.

### **File Encryption and Decryption**

1. **Encrypting a File**:
    Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a secure format that cannot be understood without decryption. Java provides various classes for encryption, such as `CipherOutputStream` (a subclass of `FilterOutputStream`) which is used to encrypt the output stream.
    
    - **Code Explanation**:
      ```java
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("first.txt"); // Creates the file "first.txt"
      CipherOutputStream cos = new CipherOutputStream(fos, cipher);  // cipher is the encryption algorithm
      ```
      - The `cipher` object defines the algorithm used for encryption (e.g., AES, DES, etc.). The actual encryption is done while writing data to the `cos` stream.
      - `cos.write("This is encrypted data".getBytes())`: Converts the string into bytes and encrypts it before writing to the file.
      - After encryption, always close the stream:
      ```java
      cos.close();
      ```

2. **Decrypting a File**:
    Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. The `CipherInputStream` class decrypts data as it is read from the input stream.

    - **Code Explanation**:
      ```java
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("first.txt"); // Opens the encrypted file for reading
      CipherInputStream cis = new CipherInputStream(fis, cipher);  // cipher is the decryption algorithm
      ```
      - The `cipher` object here is configured for decryption.
      - The `cis.read()` method reads the decrypted data one byte at a time and prints it:
      ```java
      int data;
      while ((data = cis.read()) != -1) {
          System.out.print((char) data); // Cast the byte data to char and print it
      }
      cis.close();
      ```

### **DataOutputStream and DataInputStream**

- **DataOutputStream**:
    This class allows writing primitive data types (such as `int`, `float`, etc.) to a file in a machine-independent way. It ensures that the data format is consistent, making the files portable between platforms.
    
    **Common Methods**:
    - `writeUTF(String s)`: Writes a `String` in UTF format (more efficient than plain text).
    - `writeInt(int i)`: Writes an `int` to the output stream.
    - `writeFloat(float f)`: Writes a `float` to the output stream.
    - `writeBoolean(boolean b)`: Writes a `boolean` value (`true` or `false`).

- **DataInputStream**:
    This class is used to read primitive data types from a file. The format of data written by `DataOutputStream` can be read back using `DataInputStream`.

    **Common Methods**:
    - `readUTF()`: Reads a `String` in UTF format.
    - `readInt()`: Reads an `int`.
    - `readFloat()`: Reads a `float`.
    - `readBoolean()`: Reads a `boolean`.

---

### **ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream**

- **ObjectOutputStream**:
    This class is used to serialize Java objects and write them to a file or any other output stream. **Serialization** is the process of converting an object’s state into a byte stream that can be saved or transmitted.
    
    - **Serializable Interface**: 
      To serialize an object, its class must implement the `Serializable` interface, which is a marker interface (i.e., it does not define any methods). Implementing this interface tells the JVM that instances of the class can be serialized.

    - **Example**:
      ```java
      class Person implements Serializable {
          private String name;
          private int age;

          // Constructors, getters, setters
      }
      ```
      - Here, `Person` is a class that can be serialized because it implements `Serializable`.

      - **Writing Object**:
        ```java
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("person.dat"));
        oos.writeObject(new Person("John", 30)); // Writes the "Person" object to the file
        oos.close();
        ```

- **ObjectInputStream**:
    This class is used to deserialize objects that were previously serialized and stored in a file or another input stream. **Deserialization** is the process of reconstructing the object from the byte stream.

    - **Reading Object**:
      ```java
      ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("person.dat"));
      Person person = (Person) ois.readObject(); // Reads and casts the deserialized object
      ois.close();
      ```

---

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Data streams**: `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream` work with primitive data types, ensuring that the data format is consistent across platforms.
- **Object streams**: `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` are used for writing and reading entire objects, provided the objects implement the `Serializable` interface.
- **Encryption**: `CipherOutputStream` and `CipherInputStream` are used for secure file writing and reading using encryption/decryption algorithms.
- Always ensure to **close** the streams after their operation to avoid resource leaks.
